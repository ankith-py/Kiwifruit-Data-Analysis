# Kiwifruit-Data-Analysis
Secondary data analysis conducted on the "Firmness" variable on the research paper titled "Optimization of Postharvest Ultrasonic Treatment of Kiwifruit using RSM" by K. Vivek, K.V. Subbarao, &amp; B. Srivastava

A full second order polynomial regression model was created with all terms (first order, two-way interaction, pure quadratic) as shown by the
significance table outputted from the R code. Since every term that containes the 'Temperature' variable is not
significant, the temperature factor is completely excluded in the reduced model.

Contour plots and 3D diagrams are produced to visualize the relationship among predictors and our response variable, 'Firmness'.
